# mylang

The idea being to first create a very simple parser that I am happy with. Then I create a backend (either LLVM or javascript).

It really shouldnt matter as it would be cool to be able to swap backends anyway.


## Goal

The goal of this programming language is nothing else than teaching me how to create parsers and codegenarators.
